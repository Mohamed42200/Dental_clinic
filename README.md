# Dental_clinic
I'm developing the backend of a Clinic Management System using Django REST Framework, implementing core features like patient registration, appointment scheduling, and API-based data handling.

To ensure a stateless architecture and improve scalability, I integrated JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. The backend is designed to later connect seamlessly with a frontend interface to complete the full system.
